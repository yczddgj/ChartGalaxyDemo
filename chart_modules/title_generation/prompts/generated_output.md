Generate a text image with the content of "Urban Tree Canopy Coverage by Neighborhood". Generate a text image for a poster title. Arrange the text in exactly 2 lines. The top line reads 'Urban Tree Canopy Coverage' and the bottom line reads 'by Neighborhood'. The top line, 'Urban Tree Canopy Coverage', is prominently displayed with a larger font size and features a fresh gradient color transitioning from a vibrant green to a lighter green, evoking nature and growth. The second line, 'by Neighborhood', uses a smaller, secondary font size in a clean, legible dark grey color, providing context. Both lines are rendered in a modern, clean sans-serif typeface. Around the upper text, 'Urban Tree Canopy Coverage', incorporate subtle, stylized green leaves and delicate branches, gently intertwining with the letters to reinforce the theme of tree canopies. Below or subtly behind the lower text, 'by Neighborhood', include a faint, abstract outline of an urban skyline in a light, desaturated tone, grounding the text in its neighborhood context. The overall composition prioritizes the two-line structure, leaving appropriate negative space to maintain clarity and visual balance.
