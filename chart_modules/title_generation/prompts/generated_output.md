Generate a text image with the content of "Seats Distribution Among European Member States". Create an image with the text "Seats Distribution" on the first line and "Among European Member States" on the second line. The first line should be the main title and prominently displayed, using a large, bold, futuristic font with a glowing effect to capture attention. Emphasize the words "Seats" and "Distribution" by enlarging the font size and making them in a bright color, such as #FFCC00, while keeping "Among European Member States" in a more subdued, white color. 

Add a decorative element by incorporating an icon of a stylized map of Europe, replacing the letter "o" in "Among" with this icon. This map would integrate smoothly into the word, maintaining the overall flow of the text. Surround the text with soft graphic elements, such as abstract lines or curves that represent connectivity and collaboration, positioned lightly behind the text to enhance readability while adding depth to the composition.

For the artistic effect, apply a subtle texture overlay on the text that mimics a metallic finish, with slight reflections to give it a modern and professional look. The overall design should balance clarity with visual interest, ensuring the message is immediately recognizable while inviting the viewer into a deeper exploration of the topic.
