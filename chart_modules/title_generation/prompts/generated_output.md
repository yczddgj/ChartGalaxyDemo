The title is arranged in two lines, center-aligned. The first line, "Global Space Funding," consists of four words, while the second line, "by Country, 2024," contains seven words. The main emphasis is on the first line, which should be in a larger font size than the second line to highlight the title effectively. 

The font style is sans-serif, bold, modern, and clean, delivering a professional and contemporary look. The text color is dark gray, ensuring high contrast against the light background, enhancing readability.

For decoration, graphics should be added around the text. Specifically, a subtle graphic of a stylized planet can be placed to the left of the first line and a tiny rocket icon to the right of the second line. Both icons should be simple and minimalistic, matching the overall design style without overpowering the text itself. 

No additional artistic effects, such as shadows or outlines, are to be included, maintaining the minimalistic aesthetic. The overall presentation is clean, professional, and geared towards analytical content, embodying clarity and modernity.
