Generate a text image with the content of "App Store Growth: iOS vs Google Play". A text image for a poster title. Arrange the text in exactly 2 lines. Top line: 'App Store Growth'. Bottom line: 'iOS vs Google Play'. The font is a modern, clean, bold sans-serif typeface. On the top line, the word 'Growth' is rendered significantly larger than 'App Store'. On the bottom line, 'iOS' and 'Google Play' are rendered larger and bolder than 'vs'. 'iOS' is colored in a vibrant blue, and 'Google Play' is colored in a vibrant green. The text features a subtle metallic sheen and clean, sharp edges with a very slight, soft drop shadow for definition. Decorate the text with flat, modern, vector-style icons. A subtle upward-trending line graph icon is integrated near the word 'Growth' on the first line. A stylized Apple logo icon is placed to the immediate left of 'iOS', and a stylized Google Play Store logo icon is placed to the immediate left of 'Google Play' on the second line. Small, generic, outline-style app icons are subtly scattered and floating around the overall text block, maintaining significant empty space around the central text for a clean, focused composition.
