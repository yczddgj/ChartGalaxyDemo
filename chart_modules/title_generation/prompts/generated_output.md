Generate a text image with the content of "Global Space Funding by Country, 2024". Global Space Funding  
by Country, 2024  

The first line "Global Space Funding" should be emphasized with a larger font size to denote it as the main title. The second line "by Country, 2024" should be placed directly below the first line, center-aligned, in a slightly smaller size to create a visual hierarchy. 

To add a decorative touch, incorporate a simple rocket icon to replace the letter "o" in the word "Global." The icon should be clean and minimalistic, matching the overall font style. 

The chosen font style is sans-serif, bold, and modern, reflecting a futuristic theme appropriate for the space funding context. No additional artistic effects, such as shadows or glows, will be used to maintain a minimalistic and professional appearance. The color scheme will follow a dark gray or black for text to ensure strong contrast and clarity over the light background.
