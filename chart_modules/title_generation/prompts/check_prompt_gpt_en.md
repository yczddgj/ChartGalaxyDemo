This is the title image of a poster. **What is the text displayed in the image?** Does the image correctly display the sentence "{title}"? **ATTENTION! Do not consider case distinction! The uppercase and lowercase versions of the same letter should be treated as the same letter.** The result is 'Yes' or 'No'. The definition of "correct display" can refer to the following:

**ATTENTION! The different use of uppercase and lowercase letters does not result in incorrect display! It does not matter!!!!**

1. There are some situations that fall under **correct display**:
   - Some letters or parts of letters are replaced by icons or symbols, but the original letter and the new graphic shape are similar, and the new graphic can visually suggest the original letter.
   - Some icons or illustrations are used to decorate the text, making it more vivid, but without affecting the reader's ability to read and recognize the text.
   - The punctuation in the text displayed in the image is different from that in "{title}". **The punctuation is not important**.
   - **Line Breaks**: The text should be arranged in lines as appropriate for its length. Typically 1-3 lines.

2. There are certain situations that definitely fall under **incorrect display**:
   - The text displayed in the image is missing one or more words from "{title}".
   - The text displayed in the image has duplicate one or more words from "{title}".
   - The text displayed in the image has different words compared to "{title}".
   - **Excessive Lines**: The text is split into 4 or more lines (unless the text is extremely long). Ideally it should be 1 or 2 lines.

In addition to checking the text content, please also evaluate if the line breaks are reasonable (not too many lines).
If the text content is correct AND the line count is reasonable (<= 3 lines), answer 'Yes'. Otherwise answer 'No'.
