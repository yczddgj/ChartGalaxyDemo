# Task Requirements
I want to generate a **text image**, which will be used as the title of a poster in the future. Please help me generate a text segment as a **prompt for a text-to-image model** to create an appropriate text image. The content of the text is **"{title}"**, and the image background is **pure white**. You need to design it from the following three perspectives (**Attention! The following content is provided only as a prompt for your consideration. No response or output is required!**):

## Text Layout and Emphasis
In this aspect, you will decide the **overall layout of the text**. You need to appropriately break down the title "{title}" into lines according to its semantics. and consider whether certain key text should be emphasized. If "{title}" includes two or more sentences, the first sentence should be the main title, and the following sentences do not need to be emphasized.
Please provide:
1. How many lines the text should be split into (**each line must contain more than 5 words, and you must provide exactly 1 or 2 lines**). The extra space above and below the text should be kept blank.
2. The specific content of each line.
3. If there is key text, provide:
   - The key text that should be emphasized.
   - The method of emphasizing the key text, such as enlarging the font, changing the color, or using different colors for each letter.
4. **In the prompt, you need to stress that the text must be arranged following the line allocation requirements.**

## Decoration with Icons
In this aspect, you will decide whether to **decorate the text with icons**. You need to determine if "{title}" is suitable for replacing a letter or part of a letter with an icon. If so, please provide: 
1. The specific content of the icon.
2. Which letter (or part of the letter) in which word the icon will replace.
3. The icon’s color must be selected from the same restricted RGB palette as the text, listed below. The icon should visually integrate with the typography and overall color harmony.

## Font Style and Artistic Effects
In this aspect, you will decide the **font style and artistic effects** for the text. You need to judge whether "{title}" is suitable for a specific font style (e.g., classical, futuristic, anime-style, etc.) and certain artistic text effects (e.g., cracks on the text surface, melting text, etc.). If applicable, please provide:
1. The font style, such as classical, futuristic, anime-style, etc.
   - Follow this font style direction: {font_style}
2. The artistic effect, such as cracks on the text surface, melting text, burning text, etc.
   - Apply this artistic effect: {artistic_effect}
3. The background should be **pure white**.
4. In addition, you must ensure that the font color used in the title is selected strictly from the following RGB values:
{color}. Any icons or decorative elements used within the text must also use colors exclusively from this same palette.


# Output
**Output Requirements**:
1. Directly output a text segment as a prompt for a text-to-image model, without any markdown code.
2. Describe the design requirements as detailed as possible, but there is no need to elaborate on the purpose and significance of the design.
3. Do not answer each dimension one by one according to the task requirements. Instead, integrate the designs from all dimensions and output them together.
4. Avoid describing your design solely with stylistic adjectives. You should translate your design into specific presentation methods and scenarios.

Based on the three dimensions above, please output your design:
